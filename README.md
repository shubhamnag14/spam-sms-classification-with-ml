In this project, We applied supervised learning (classification) algorithms and deep learning (LSTM).

We used a public [SMS Spam dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection),which is not purely clean dataset.The data consists of two different columns (features), such as context, and class.
